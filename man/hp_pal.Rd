\title{Harry Potter Colour Map.}
\usage{
hp_pal(alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1, movie = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The alpha transparency, a number in [0,1], see argument alpha in
\code{\link[grDevices]{hsv}}.}

\item{begin}{The (corrected) hue in [0,1] at which the hp colormap begins.}

\item{end}{The (corrected) hue in [0,1] at which the hp colormap ends.}

\item{direction}{Sets the order of colors in the scale. If 1, the default, colors
are ordered from darkest to lightest. If -1, the order of colors is reversed.}

\item{movie}{A character string indicating the colormap movie to use. Eight
movies are available: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8. It is also accepted to desigate
the 8th movie as 7.2 and the 7th movie as 7.1.}

\item{n}{The number of colors (\eqn{\ge 1}) to be in the palette.}
}
\value{
\code{hp} returns a character vector, \code{cv}, of color hex
codes. This can be used either to create a user-defined color palette for
subsequent graphics by \code{palette(cv)}, a \code{col =} specification in
graphics functions or in \code{par}.
}
\description{
This function creates a vector of \code{n} equally spaced colors along the
'HP colour map' created by an average calculated for all the colours present in every frame of the pictures.
}
\details{
\if{html}{Here are the color scales:

  \out{<div style="text-align: center">}\figure{hp-scales.png}{movies: style="width:750px;max-width:90\%;"}\out{</div>}

  }
\if{latex}{Here are the color scales:

  \out{\begin{center}}\figure{hp-scales.png}\out{\end{center}}
  }


Semi-transparent colors (\eqn{0 < alpha < 1}) are supported only on some
devices: see \code{\link[grDevices]{rgb}}.

\examples{
library(ggplot2)
library(hexbin)

dat <- data.frame(x = rnorm(10000), y = rnorm(10000))

ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_hex() + coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = hp(256, movie = 1))

# using code from RColorBrewer to demo the palette
n = 200
image(
  1:n, 1, as.matrix(1:n),
  col = hp(n, movie = 1),
